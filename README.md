# ❌Tic Tac Toe ⭕
My first attempt at a functional browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Here's the [link](https://cobaltdingus.github.io/tictactoe/) to my project.

# About
Tic-Tac-Toe is meant to be played between two people. 

To begin, just click on any tile on the board to place a token. Player One (the 'X' token) goes first, followed by Player Two (the 'O' token). The game continues until one player fills three consecutive squares - horizontal, vertical, or diagonal - with their respective token, upon which they win the round. Alternatively, if all tiles are filled with no winner, the game ends in a draw.
